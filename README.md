> [!NOTE]
> Please Test Any MCU you have and tell me the result.

This library facilitates EEPROM emulation on microcontrollers by selecting the latest sector or page for emulation space.
---
* Install Library from https://github.com/nimaltd/STM32-PACK/raw/main/EE/NimaLTD.I-CUBE-EE.pdsc
* Add and enable it.
* It does not need to any configuration. This Library Select the latest page/sector of the MCU.
* Generate Code.
* Set a buffer for Storing the Data ( array, struct, ...)
* Call EE_Init()

The old Version: https://github.com/nimaltd/ee/archive/refs/tags/V2.0.6.zip

```
#include "ee.h"
typedef struct
{
 uint32_t val1;
 uint32_t val2;
 uint32_t val3;
 uint32_t val4;
 uint32_t val5;
 uint32_t val6;
 uint32_t val7;
 uint32_t val8;

} Stotrage_t;

Stotrage_t ee;

.
.

int main(void)
{
  .
  .
  EE_Init(&ee, sizeof(Stotrage_t));
  EE_Read();
  ee.val1 = 1;
  ee.val2 = 2;
  ee.val3 = 3;
  ee.val4 = 4;
  ee.val5 = 5;
  ee.val6 = 6;
  ee.val7 = 7;
  ee.val8 = 8;
  EE_Write();
  while (1)
  {

  }
}
```
